# Odin Flight Booker

This app is for finding and booking one-way flights.

You select your "From" and "To" airports, and what date you want to fly on.
Then you search for available flights and choose one from the options.
After picking your flight, you enter in the information for all your passengers.
Finally, you enter your billing information and book your flight.

Happy journeys!
